* TCP/IP Basics

** What Is TCP/IP?
*** Learning Objectives
    + Networks and network protocols
    + History of TCP/IP
    + Important features of TCP/IP

      *Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)* is a _protocol system_ --- a
      collection of protocols that supports a network communications.  The answer to the question
      _What is a protocol?_ begins with the question _What is a network?_

      This section describes what a *network* is and shows why networks _need_ *protocols*.  This
      section explains what *TCP/IP* is, what it does, and where it began.

      Afterm this section, you should be able to:

      - Define the term _network_

      - Explain what a network _protocol suite_ is

      - Discuss the history of TCP/IP

      - List some important features of TCP/IP

      - Identify the organizations that oversee TCP/IP and the Internet

      - Explain what *RFCs* are and where to find them

    + TCP/IP protocol system
    + The OSI Model
    + Data packages
    + How TCP/IP protocols interact

      TCP/IP is a system (suite) of protocols; a protocol is a system of rules and procedures.  The
      hardware and software of the communicating computers carry out the rules of TCP/IP
      communications --- the user does not have to get involved with the details.  A working
      knowledge of TCP/IP is essential if you want to navigate through the configuration and
      troubleshoot problems with TCP/IP networks.

      At the completion:

      - Describe the layers of the TCP/IP protocol system, and the purpose of each layer

      - Describe the layers of the OSI model and explain how the OSI layers relate to TCP/IP

      - Explain TCP/IP protocol headers and how data is enclosed with header information at each
        layer of the protocol stack

      - Name the data package at each layer of the TCP/IP stack

      - Discuss the TCP, UDP, and IP protocols and how they work together to provide TCP/IP
        functionality
